# The Search Engines Timeline

![Thumbnail of the Search Engines Timeline](default_img.png?raw=true "The Search Engines Timeline")

An attempt to list key events associated with search engines throughout history. [See it live!](https://markwhen.com/timeline/9d8db859-6a1d-4b67-b3f0-3f3fc49e8eca)

## MW format

The timeline is saved in MW (markwhen) format. It's a file format that can be used on [markwhen](https://markwhen.com/) to generate interactive timelines.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute by adding new engines and/or details to the timeline.mw file. After all, this is a global project and we share the same space potato.

I don't necessarily have time to do the research and add all the details I would have liked, most of the details are taken from Wikipedia to go faster.

If you make a pull request, I will take care of regenerating the public link of the timeline and update the README.md accordingly.
